				<p><span class='firstChar'>W</span>ant to look fresh, radiant and young? For this, it is very important that the content of skin hydration is perfect. We have what your skin needs: Dermothetique Hydro-Activ is an innovative moisturizing therapy, with cellular activators, that intensely treats dry and dehydrated skin. The Biosthétique has developed with DERMOSTHETIQUE HYDRO-ACTIF a care that limits with medicine.</p>
				<p><strong>Regenetating treatment</strong> provides cell-active anti-aging repair care for the night. A highly effective combination of plant extracts in TRAITEMENT REGENERANT activates the skin’s repair mechanisms overnight, tightening and strengthening the skin’s hydrolipid barrier for a youthfully fresh appearance in the morning. Liposomally encapsulated phyto cell extracts maintain the health and regenerative capacity of the skin’s mother cells; glyco cell extracts from silicone-containing brown algae protect the skin against loss of elasticity due to saccharification, activate the collagen production and calm the skin. The collagen fibre network is supported; the skin becomes supple and looks younger. Liposomally encapsulated soybean isoflavones strengthen the skin and make it more resistant, cactus-like salt marsh plant (salicornia) intensifies the skin’s moisture binding. The skin becomes tighter. A biomimetic peptide complex results in a gentle skin-exfoliating effect. The skin becomes softer, the wrinkle depth is decreased and uneven pigmentation is balanced out.</p>
				<p><strong>Méthode Sensitive</strong> enables particularly sensitive, dry skin to become skin that looks and feels more relaxed. In this range La Biosthétique includes special ingredients of plant oils that combat the cause of sensitive skin. The skin’s protective functions are stabilised, the barrier layer is strengthened, moisture is able to be bound in the skin again. With its pleasantly light texture, sensitive scent formulation and a skin barrier-strengthening active ingredient concept.  Whether hereditary or lack of skin elasticity and resilience: the causes of dry skin are many and varied. Excessive care and cleansers can also dehydrate the skin. If the skin is sensitive, it reacts to countless external influences with tightness, redness, tingling and dry skin areas. To give this skin the perfect care, it not only needs a product that provides oils and moisturisers, but also makes the skin feel good and restores balance to the impaired barrier function of sensitive skin. Méthode Sensitive was specially developed for precisely this skin type: with more intense effects thanks to state-of-the-art research, skin problem-based formulation adjustments and a new scent formulation, especially for sensitive skin.</p>

				<p><strong>Oat lipids:</strong> Rich in valuable ingredients  for youthfully cared for skin: Stabilises the skin’s protective functions. The high content of antioxidants also protects the skin lipids from damage by free radicals. The defective skin barrier is repaired. Special plant oil components, known as phytosterols, also combat the cause of sensitive skin. Regardless of your skin type, age or gender, relaxed wellbeing is restored to the skin.  Phytosterols: the amazing plant active ingredient for sensitive skin For relaxed, soft skin: Restructures the impaired barrier function of sensitive skin. Strengthens and protects the skin barrier layer, binds moisture and also ensures an intact lipid layer. Instantly and noticeably reduces skin irritation.</p>
				<p>We have what your skin needs and  guarantee results after the firts session. The range of products can solve all skin problems you have.</p>
				<p>The makeup by La Biosthetique we offer  is laboratory and medicly tested and helps maintenein the condition of the skin after every treatment you have done. As well is recommended as after care from our beauty therapiest as it contains anti- aging and anti-inflamatory  elements.

				<p><span class='firstChar'>W</span>hat is a relaxing massage? Relaxation massage is usually a full-body treatment involving soft music, soft lighting and aromatherapy oils. You will have a long, luxurious massage which will use all kinds of techniques including long strokes, gentle kneading and rolling of skin and muscle, and perhaps some rhythmic rocking from side to side.</p>
				<p>The benefits from it are that relieves stress and tension in your muscles and will leave you oozing with a sense of wellbeing. It achieves this because of the general benefits of massage: it improves your circulation, so your organs and skin get more oxygen; it moves fluid through your lymphatic system. A relaxation massage encourages your body to digest its food, and get rid of its toxins. It will help you to sleep better.
				After the session our team will offer you cup of strong green tea which will complete the course and enhance the benefits from the massage.</p>
